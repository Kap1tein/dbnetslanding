# DBNETS  Landing Page

This is a basic landing page created for DBNETS using basic HTML and Tailwind CSS.

##  Using Tailwind CSS

Everything is added in the node_modules so you just need to run `npm install` to get everything you need.

## Generating new Tailwind CSS

If you add new colors or variables, you'll need to generate a new Tailwind CSS that'll render everything you need while still purging all unused classes.
You can do this with: `npm run prod`
